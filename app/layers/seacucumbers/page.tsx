            Sea cucumbers are fascinating marine animals that belong to the
            class Holothuroidea, within the phylum Echinodermata â€” the same
            group that includes sea stars and sea urchins. Despite their name
            and cucumber-like shape, they are animals, not plants or vegetables.
