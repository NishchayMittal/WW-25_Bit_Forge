            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h5>
              Welcome to Oceanic Explorer ‚Äì an interactive digital platform
              dedicated to the comprehensive exploration and understanding of
              the world‚Äôs oceans. Developed as an academic initiative, this
              website aims to educate, engage, and inspire users by offering
              structured and scientifically-grounded insights into the
              biological layers of the ocean. The ocean covers more than 70% of
              the Earth‚Äôs surface, yet much of it remains unexplored and
              misunderstood. With this in mind, Oceanic Explorer was created to
              bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and public awareness.
              It serves as a learning tool for students, educators, researchers,
              and ocean enthusiasts who wish to delve deeper into the diverse
              ecosystems beneath the waves.

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <h5>
              Our mission is to provide an engaging and educational platform
              that promotes ocean literacy through accurate information,
              interactive tools, and enjoyable experiences. We aim to spark
              curiosity about marine life, highlight the importance of ocean
              conservation, and encourage further study of this vital part of
              our planet.

          <h5>
            This project was initiated as part of an academic endeavor to
            combine web development skills with environmental education.
            Recognizing the lack of accessible and interactive resources focused
            on oceanic biology, Oceanic Explorer was envisioned as a solution to
            make complex marine science approachable for learners of all levels.

            As we continue to grow, we plan to expand our content offerings,
            introduce more advanced features, and collaborate with experts in
            marine science to ensure accuracy and relevance. Our long-term goal
            is to evolve from a student project into a trusted resource for
            ocean education globally.
